I'm an apsiring data scientist, experienced with Python and R programming. I have solid understanding of machine learning techniques and algorithms. I have machine learning projects solving real-business problems on financial and healthcare data, and experience on dashboard designing, and cloud computing.


I am a multi-tasker and a fast learner, with intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, proactive problem-solving, and effective communication. I love working on projects which are full of challenges, so feel free to reach out.
